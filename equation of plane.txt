what is the equation of a plane
ax + by + cz + d = 0

3 points

1 2 3


ax1 + by1 + cz1 + d = 0

ax2 + by2 + cz2 + d = 0

ax3 + by3 + cz3 + d = 0

put it in matrix form


x   y   z   1
x1  y1  z1  1
x2  y2  z2  1
x3  y3  z3  1

*

a
b
c
d

=

0

matrix multiplication equals 0 when the determenant is equal to 0

|x   y   z   1|
|x1  y1  z1  1|
|x2  y2  z2  1|
|x3  y3  z3  1|

=

0

get rid of top row/1st col and multiply by x. repeat for y and z, alternating signs.

x

*

|y1  z1  1|
|y2  z2  1|
|y3  z3  1|

and make it all set to 0.

it is the equation of the data.

his shortcut for multiplying
go down across to right
subtract down across to left
