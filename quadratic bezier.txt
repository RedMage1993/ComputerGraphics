"quadratic bezier of the form [P1, C, P2] (where C is the control point) you can form an equivalent cubic bezier with [P1, (C*2/3 + P1 * 1/3), (C*2/3 + P2 * 1/3), P2]. "

DrawBezier
so you only need 4 points top and bottom

OR use the bezier.png equation with 0 <= t <= 1 to get all the
points in between
