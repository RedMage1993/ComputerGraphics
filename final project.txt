SpaceChickens
-------------
Character
Sprite


Chickens are being shot into freaking space.
You want to collect them but your space ship is stuck in Ninja mode, so you must
be careful and time the collection perfectly.

SAVE THE CHICKENS



Maybe you can use splines for power ups that fly in from the side of the screen.
Like UFOs that are coming in and then go zig-zagging around!



Background: Space, nice galaxy art, stars glowing
Projectiles: Cute little stupid chickens
Controller: Mouse position
Main character: Spaceship, rotating about its center, with two big electrical fields
on both ends.

chickens must look dumb, just slowly rotating/drifting in space in a random direction
